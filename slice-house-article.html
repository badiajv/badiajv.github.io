            <p>When it comes to pizza places, Huntersville, like most places, is in no short supply. You've got your Macros, your Domino's, Jet's, all the recognizable franchise names. But there's one that stands out for being unique to our town, and that's Slice House. Located in Central Huntersville off Old Statesville Road, this restaurant has a certain level of quality to it that you just can't quite get from a franchise. The food is great and while the prices are admittedly a bit higher then some of their competitors, they are far from unreasonable. Overall, Slice House is an amazing local restaurant that I would highly recommend giving a try if you haven't already.</p>
